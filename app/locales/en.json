High Stress can be positive, leading to a quick sense of danger and noticing if something is wrong or unusual. But ultimately or over time, it can leave you exhausted. Some people may become addicted to the adrenaline caused by stressful living, thereby becoming masterful at creating it. The challenge is to recognize when we are becoming stressed and train ourselves to direct that energy in a positive way, such as taking a walk, going for a swim, reading a book, etc. rather than allowing it to take you into the Distress Levels.
